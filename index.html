I am a third year Computer Science Ph.D. student at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), New York. I am advised by [Dr. Xumin Liu](https://www.rit.edu/directory/xmlics-xumin-liu) and I collaborate with the [Machine Learning and Data Intensive Computing Lab](https://www.rit.edu/mining/) led by [Dr. Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/directory/qyuvks-qi-yu).

My research explores **Adversarial Robustness**, **Continual Learning**, and **Data-Efficient Deep Learning**. The models I work with are primarily based on **Vision Transformers**, **Vision Language Models**, **Large Language Models**, and **CNNs**.
